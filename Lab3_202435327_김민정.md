# My project plan (Level 1 Heading)
***Note:*** This document is written merely as an illustrative example, and does not provide any working guide to an actual project. 

### Proposal (Level 3 Heading)
---
I am pianning to make a computer vision software that detect abjects in images.

In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://github.com/TensorFlow) or [PyTorch](https://github.com/Pytorch), and other open source softwares.

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection):

### Dependencies (Level 3 Heading)
- python
- opencv-python
- tensorflow
- openmmlab
- package manager

### Installation
In a bash terminal, run the following commads (Do NOT actually run these commands in your computer):
```sh
$ sudo apt update 
$ conda create -n cv_detection
$ conda activate cv_detection
$ python --version
$ python example.py
```
